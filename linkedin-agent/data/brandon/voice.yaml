        There's something uniquely strategic about the Asian session that keeps 
        me coming back to it—especially when trading Gold Futures (GC). During 
        these quieter market hours, I find that price action is cleaner, liquidity 
        is thinner (but not erratic), and institutional footprints are more visible.
