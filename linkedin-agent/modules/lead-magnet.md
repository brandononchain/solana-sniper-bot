# Lead Magnet Multiplier

Create ready-to-post lead magnets that convert followers into pipeline.

## The Philosophy

Lead magnets aren't PDFs. They're value exchanges.

**Bad lead magnet:** "Download my free guide!"
**Good lead magnet:** Solve a specific problem so well they want more.

## Lead Magnet Types for LinkedIn

### 1. The Carousel/Document Post
PDF or carousel with actionable content.

```
Format: 8-12 slides
Structure:
- Slide 1: Hook + Promise
- Slide 2: Problem/Pain
- Slides 3-9: The content (frameworks, tips, examples)
- Slide 10: Recap
- Slide 11: CTA
- Slide 12: About/Follow
```

**Best for:** Frameworks, step-by-steps, checklists

---

### 2. The Template Drop
Give them something immediately usable.

```
"Here's the exact [template] I use for [outcome].

[Preview of template]

Comment 'SEND' and I'll DM it to you."
```

**Best for:** Emails, scripts, spreadsheets, SOPs

---

### 3. The Mini-Course
Multi-post series that builds.

```
"I'm going to teach you [skill] in 5 posts.

This is post 1 of 5.

[Content]

Follow + 🔔 to catch the rest."
```

**Best for:** Complex topics, authority building

---

### 4. The Resource List
Curated tools/resources with your commentary.

```
"I've tested 47 [tools] this year.
Here are the 7 that actually work:

1. [Tool] - [Why]
2. [Tool] - [Why]
...

Save this post. You'll need it."
```

**Best for:** Tools, books, resources

---

### 5. The Case Study
Deep dive into a specific result.

```
"How [client] went from [A] to [B].

The full breakdown:

[Problem]
[Solution]
[Results]
[Lessons]

Want me to review your [thing]? 
Comment below."
```

**Best for:** Social proof, demonstrating expertise

---

### 6. The Swipe File
Collection of examples they can steal.

```
"I saved every [cold email/hook/ad] that got me.

Here are my top 10:

1. [Example + why it worked]
...

Screenshot this thread."
```

**Best for:** Copywriting, creative, inspiration

---

### 7. The Challenge
Engage them in action.

```
"7-day [outcome] challenge:

Day 1: [Action]
Day 2: [Action]
...

Comment 'IN' and I'll check on you Friday."
```

**Best for:** Habit building, community engagement

## Lead Magnet Creation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Pain

From ICP analysis:
- What do they struggle with?
- What questions do they ask repeatedly?
- What would save them time/money/stress?

### Step 2: Match to Format

| Pain Type | Best Format |
|-----------|-------------|
| "How do I..." | Template, Framework |
| "What should I..." | Checklist, Decision tree |
| "Show me examples" | Swipe file, Case study |
| "I don't have time" | Cheat sheet, Tool list |
| "I keep failing at..." | Troubleshooting guide |

### Step 3: Create the Content

Requirements:
- Immediately actionable
- Specific (not generic advice)
- Complete (don't hold back for the paid thing)
- Branded (they remember you)

### Step 4: Design the Post

```yaml
post_structure:
  hook: "Stop the scroll"
  problem: "Why they need this"
  preview: "Taste of the value"
  social_proof: "Why you're credible"
  cta: "How to get it"
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Funnel

```
Post → Comment → DM → Conversation → Call → Revenue

At each step:
- Track conversion rate
- Optimize the handoff
- Personalize the follow-up
```

## Top Performer Patterns

Analyze what works in your niche:

### Pattern Analysis
```yaml
top_performers:
  - creator: "@competitor1"
    magnet: "The Sales Playbook"
    type: "carousel"
    engagement: 50000
    why_worked:
      - "Specific numbers in results"
      - "Preview showed actual content"
      - "Easy CTA (just comment)"
      
  - creator: "@competitor2"
    magnet: "100 Cold Email Examples"
    type: "swipe file"
    engagement: 35000
    why_worked:
      - "Volume implies value"
      - "Immediately usable"
      - "Social proof in comments"
```

### Replicate the Winning Elements

From analysis, extract:
- Title formulas that work
- Preview styles that convert
- CTA formats that get action
- Topics with proven demand

---

## CTA Formulas

### Low Friction
```
"Comment [WORD] and I'll send it over."
"Save this for later."
"Follow for more like this."
```

### Medium Friction
```
"Comment [WORD] + follow and I'll DM you."
"Drop your email in comments."
"Comment what you're struggling with."
```

### High Friction (Use Sparingly)
```
"Link in bio to download."
"Fill out this form."
"Book a call to discuss."
```

**Rule:** Match friction to value. Big value = can ask for more.

## Multiplier Strategy

Turn 1 lead magnet into 5+ pieces:

```
Original: "The 7-Step Sales Framework"

Multiply into:
1. Full carousel post
2. Thread breaking down each step
3. Quick-tip post for step 1
4. Story post about creating it
5. Results post from someone using it
6. Myth-busting post about one step
7. Behind-the-scenes on how you developed it
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Generic content** — "10 tips for success" helps no one
❌ **Holding back** — Giving 50% to save the rest for paid
❌ **Complex CTAs** — More steps = fewer conversions
❌ **No follow-up** — Collecting comments and ghosting
❌ **One and done** — Not repurposing across formats
❌ **Mismatched audience** — Great magnet, wrong ICP
