## The Content Formula

### Post 3x Per Week

**Ideal mix:**
- 1 Value post (tactical, actionable)
- 1 Story post (experience, lesson)
- 1 Engagement post (question, hot take)

**Posting schedule:**
- Tue/Wed/Thu mornings (8-9am EST)
- Avoid Fridays and weekends

### Content Creation Flow

```
1. Pick topic from content calendar
2. Select hook pattern that matches
3. Write using voice profile
4. Run through checklist:
   □ Hook stops scroll?
   □ Value is clear?
   □ Sounds like me?
   □ CTA makes sense?
5. Post and engage for first hour
```

## The Outreach Formula

### Weekly Targets

**Connections:** 15-25 new requests
**Messages:** 10-15 personalized DMs
**Follow-ups:** All open conversations

### Outreach Flow

```
1. Identify target (intent signal or ICP match)
2. Research (profile, recent content)
3. Find angle (observation, mutual, trigger)
4. Write using template + personalization
5. Send connection (if not connected)
6. Wait for accept → Send message
7. Track in outreach/tracking.yaml
8. Follow up sequence if no reply
```

### Follow-up Cadence

```
Day 0: Initial message
Day 3: Follow-up #1 (add value)
Day 7: Follow-up #2 (different angle)
Day 14: Follow-up #3 (break-up)
```

## Lead Magnet Strategy

### Always Have Active

Keep 2-3 lead magnets in rotation:
1. **Primary:** Your main value piece
2. **Topical:** Tied to current trends
3. **Quick win:** Low-friction, high-value

### Distribution Cycle

```
Week 1: Fresh post with lead magnet CTA
Week 2: Reference in relevant comments
Week 3: Share in DMs to warm leads
Week 4: Refresh or rotate to new magnet
```

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Engagement Targets

```
Comments written: 5-10
Comments replied to: All on your posts
DMs initiated: 2-3
DMs replied to: All (same day)
```

### Comment Strategy

**Where to comment:**
- Target accounts (people you want to know)
- ICP members (potential customers)
- Niche influencers (visibility)
- People who engage with you (reciprocity)

**How to comment:**
- Add insight they didn't mention
- Share relevant experience
- Ask thoughtful question
- Respectfully challenge (spicy)

**Never:**
- "Great post!"
- Self-promotional pitches
- Generic agreement

## Troubleshooting

### "My posts aren't getting engagement"

```
□ Hook strong enough? (Test contrarian/story)
□ Posting at right time?
□ Engaging before/after posting?
□ Content matches what ICP cares about?
□ Algorithm timing? (Give it 2 weeks)
```

### "Outreach not getting replies"

```
□ Personalization specific enough?
□ Value clear in first message?
□ Asking too much too soon?
□ Following up enough? (Most reply on F/U 2-3)
□ Targeting right people?
```

### "Not generating leads"

```
□ Content has clear CTA?
□ Lead magnet valuable enough?
□ Profile optimized for conversion?
□ Actually following up on engagement?
□ Asking for the meeting eventually?
```

## The Revenue Equation

```
CONTENT (builds audience)
    ↓
ENGAGEMENT (builds relationships)  
    ↓
OUTREACH (starts conversations)
    ↓
PIPELINE (qualified opportunities)
    ↓
REVENUE (closed deals)
```

**Each step feeds the next. Skip none.**
