Ready-to-adapt frameworks for LinkedIn content.

## Template 1: The Contrarian Breakdown

**Best for:** Hot takes, challenging conventional wisdom

```
[Contrarian hook statement]

[Common belief 1]
[Common belief 2]
[Common belief 3]

[Transition: "Here's the thing..."]

[Your alternative take]

[Supporting point 1]
[Supporting point 2]
[Supporting point 3]

[Landing line]

[Optional soft CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
Most networking advice is garbage.

"Add value!"
"Be authentic!"
"Build relationships!"

Here's the thing...

These are outcomes, not strategies.

What actually works:

1. Comment on 5 posts from people you want to know. Daily.
2. Share their content with your take added.
3. DM with a specific question, not a pitch.

Do this for 30 days. Then tell me networking doesn't work.

What's your networking strategy? (Real answers only)
```

## Template 2: The Transformation Story

**Best for:** Building credibility, showing results

```
[Time] ago, I was [struggling state].

[Specific detail that makes it real]

Today: [winning state]

Here's what changed:

[Change 1 — be specific]

[Change 2 — be specific]

[Change 3 — be specific]

The lesson?

[One-liner takeaway]

[CTA or question]
```

**Example:**
```
18 months ago, I was making $4k/month freelancing.

I was taking every client, working 60 hours, and still stressed about rent.

Last month: $47k. Working 30 hours.

Here's what changed:

1. I fired 80% of my clients.
Kept only the ones who paid well and were easy to work with.

2. I raised my rates 3x.
Lost some clients. The right ones stayed.

3. I stopped selling time.
Started selling outcomes with fixed pricing.

The lesson?

More isn't better. Better is better.

What would you add to this list?
```

## Template 3: The Tactical List

**Best for:** Actionable advice, high save rates

```
[Number] [things] that [outcome]:

1. [Thing]
↳ [Why/How]

2. [Thing]
↳ [Why/How]

3. [Thing]
↳ [Why/How]

[Continue as needed]

Save this. You'll need it.

[Optional: Which one are you trying first?]
```

**Example:**
```
7 cold email mistakes killing your reply rate:

1. Long subject lines
↳ Keep it under 5 words. "Quick question" beats "Exploring potential synergies"

2. Starting with "I"
↳ "Your post about X..." > "I'm reaching out because..."

3. Walls of text
↳ 3-4 short paragraphs max. Phones exist.

4. Vague compliments
↳ "Love your work" = deleted. Specific reference = read.

5. Multiple CTAs
↳ One ask. That's it.

6. No follow-up
↳ Most replies come from email 2 or 3.

7. Generic templates
↳ They can tell. Everyone can tell.

Save this. You'll need it.

Which mistake are you guilty of? (No judgment)
```

## Template 4: The Framework Reveal

**Best for:** Establishing expertise, high engagement

```
The [Name] Framework for [outcome]:

[Visual or breakdown]

Step 1: [Action]
→ [Brief explanation]

Step 2: [Action]
→ [Brief explanation]

Step 3: [Action]
→ [Brief explanation]

[Why this works in 1-2 sentences]

[CTA: Want the full breakdown? / Try it and tell me how it goes]
```

**Example:**
```
The 3-3-3 Framework for LinkedIn posts:

3 seconds to hook
3 minutes to write
3x the engagement

Here's how it works:

3 Seconds: Your first line has to stop the scroll.
→ Contrarian, specific, or curiosity-inducing. No fluff.

3 Minutes: If it takes longer, you're overthinking.
→ One idea. Simple structure. Don't write an essay.

3X Engagement: Good hooks multiply everything.
→ Same content with a weak hook = 1/3 the reach.

Most people spend 30 minutes writing posts nobody reads.

Spend 3 minutes on something worth reading.

Which of the 3 are you struggling with?
```

## Template 5: The Vulnerable Share

**Best for:** Building connection, standing out

```
[Admission or vulnerable statement]

[Context — what happened]

[What I learned]

[How I think about it now]

[Takeaway for the reader]

[Optional: Have you experienced something similar?]
```

**Example:**
```
I almost quit last year.

Revenue was up. Team was growing. By every metric, we were winning.

But I was miserable.

I'd built a business I didn't want to run.

What changed everything:

I stopped asking "How do I grow?"
Started asking "What do I actually want my days to look like?"

Turns out I wanted:
- Fewer clients (better ones)
- No team (just me and contractors)
- Work that energizes instead of drains

Revenue dropped 40%. Happiness went up 400%.

Sometimes backwards is forward.

Have you ever had to shrink to grow?
```

## Template 6: The Data Drop

**Best for:** Credibility, shareability

```
I [analyzed/tracked/measured] [specific thing].

Here's what I found:

[Finding 1] — [what it means]
[Finding 2] — [what it means]
[Finding 3] — [what it means]

The biggest surprise?

[Unexpected insight]

[What to do with this information]

[CTA or question]
```

**Example:**
```
I analyzed 500 LinkedIn posts that went viral.

Here's what I found:

73% used the first line as a hook (not a greeting)
68% were under 200 words
91% had line breaks every 1-2 sentences
Only 12% used hashtags
Only 8% had links

The biggest surprise?

Posts with emojis performed 23% WORSE than text-only.

What this means for you:

→ Spend 80% of your time on the first line
→ Write shorter than you think
→ Skip the hashtags and emojis
→ Links kill reach — put them in comments

Save this. It took me 40 hours.

What finding surprised you most?
```

## Template 7: The Myth Buster

**Best for:** Engagement, shares, strong opinions

```
"[Common advice/belief]"

This advice is [killing/hurting/ruining] your [outcome].

Here's why:

[Reason 1]

[Reason 2]

[Reason 3]

What actually works:

[Alternative approach]

[Proof or example]

[Closing statement]
```

**Example:**
```
"Post every day to grow on LinkedIn."

This advice is killing your reach.

Here's why:

1. Quality drops when you force quantity.
Nobody wants to read your filler content.

2. The algorithm rewards engagement, not frequency.
One great post beats 7 mediocre ones.

3. You'll burn out and quit.
Seen it happen a hundred times.

What actually works:

Post when you have something worth saying.
For most people, that's 2-3x per week.

I post 3x per week. Grew to 50k followers.

The person who told you to post daily?
Check how their engagement is doing.

What's your posting frequency?
```

## Template 8: The Behind the Scenes

**Best for:** Building connection, humanizing your brand

```
[Hook: What people don't see]

[The visible result]

[What's actually behind it]

[Specific detail 1]
[Specific detail 2]
[Specific detail 3]

[The real lesson]

[What this means for you]
```

**Example:**
```
You see: "I closed a $50k deal."

You don't see:

- The 47 "not right now"s before this one
- The 3am anxiety about payroll
- The client who ghosted after 6 calls
- The proposal that took 8 hours and went nowhere
- The deal I lost because I was too slow

Behind every win is a graveyard of losses.

The lesson?

You're not seeing the full picture of anyone's success.

Stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to their highlight reel.

What's one thing that looks easy but isn't?
```
