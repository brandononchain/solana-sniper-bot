# 2026-02-08 Session Notes

## Memory System Activation

User noticed memory wasn't being actively maintained (last entry: 2025-02-06 — a full year gap!).

### Actions Taken
- Created today's memory file
- Setting up heartbeat reminder to log sessions going forward
- User wants consistent session logging so past work is retrievable

### Session Context
- Starting fresh after long gap
- User: brandononchain (Brandon) — see MEMORY.md for full context
- Previous work: LinkedIn Revenue Machine, OnionXBT platform

## Today's Work

### Memory System Setup
- Created this daily memory file
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with memory logging reminders
- Confirmed memory system is now active going forward

### Multi-Session Discussion
- Brandon asked about running multiple sessions simultaneously
- Recommended: Multiple channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord) for different contexts/projects
- Also mentioned sub-agents for parallel background work
- He'll set up additional channels later

### Copy Trading System (Abandoned)
- Brandon asked about building MT4→MT5→cTrader→DXtrade→MatchTrader→TradeLocker→NinjaTrader copy system
- Estimated 2-3 months for 6-7 platforms
- Complexity: High (each platform has different APIs)
- Decision: **Abandoned** — not worth the effort

### AgentL2 Analysis
- Analyzed https://agent-l2.vercel.app/ and https://github.com/AgentL2/agent-l2
- Project I apparently helped build (not in my memory files — must have been unlogged session)
- **What it is:** L2 blockchain for AI agents to transact, earn, provide services
- **Status:** Complete foundation (~9,300 LOC), live landing page, local devnet ready
- **Components:** Smart contracts (Registry, Marketplace, Bridge), TypeScript SDK, Next.js dashboard, basic sequencer
- **Assessment:** Good technical foundation, but needs adoption. Chicken-egg problem.
- **Waiting on Brandon's decision:** Push to mainnet? Find first customer? Let it sit?

### AgentL2 Runtime Dashboard Integration (Later Session)
- Brandon provided GitHub PAT for write access (added to Clawdbot vars)
- Built full Runtime dashboard integration:
  - **New Runtime tab** in dashboard with real-time status monitoring
  - **RuntimePanel component**: status display, order counts, executor health, event log
  - **/api/runtime/status endpoint**: webhook receiver for runtime heartbeats
  - **Updated docs**: comprehensive setup guide at /docs/autonomous-agents
  - **Fixed bugs**: TypeScript errors in runtime (storage naming, ethers v6 compat)
  - **Added heartbeat**: runtime now sends status every 30 seconds to dashboard
- **Pushed to GitHub**: https://github.com/AgentL2/agent-l2 (commit 5bb551f)

### AgentL2 Hosted Runtime Platform (Same Session)
Brandon wanted non-dev users to be able to run agents without coding. Built full hosted platform:

**New 'Hosted' Tab in Dashboard:**
- Deploy agents with one click using pre-built templates
- No code required - just pick template, enter API keys, deploy
- Real-time status monitoring (running/paused/error)
- View logs, stats, earnings per agent
- Pause/resume/stop controls

**7 Executor Templates:**
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Code Review
3. Text Summarization
4. Content Generation
5. Data Extraction
6. Translation (50+ languages)
7. Custom Webhook (connect your own API)

**Full Hosted Runtime API:**
- /api/hosted/deploy, /agents, /agents/:id, pause, resume, stop, logs, config

**Architecture:**
- 'Hosted' tab → Regular users (no code)
- 'Dev Runtime' tab → Developers (self-hosted)
- Secrets encrypted with AES-256
- MVP uses in-memory store (prod needs PostgreSQL, Redis, K8s)

- **Pushed to GitHub**: commit 16658d3
- **This is THE killer feature** that differentiates AgentL2

### AgentL2 UX Polish (Same Session - Continued)
Brandon pointed out the flow was confusing - users didn't understand:
- What "registering an agent" means
- What "submitting a service" does  
- How the agent actually runs

**Redesigned Create Agent Flow:**
1. Step 1: Choose execution mode (Hosted vs Self-Hosted) - clear distinction
2. Step 2: Configure service (template pre-fills for hosted)
3. Step 3: Review & submit (explains what will happen)
4. Step 4: Success → direct CTA to configure runtime

**Other UX changes:**
- Dashboard now handles `?tab=` query param
- Tabs renamed: "Hosted" + "Dev Runtime" 
- Landing CTA: "Create Agent" + "Browse Marketplace"
- After registration redirects to appropriate runtime tab

- **Pushed to GitHub**: commit 15e06a6

### AgentL2 Architecture Decision
- **1 Wallet = 1 Agent** (confirmed, keeping this model)
- 1 Agent can have multiple Services
- Each Service can have its own hosted runtime
- Future consideration: Sub-agents (v2) - parent/child relationship with revenue split

### AgentL2 Bug Fixes & Unified Create Flow
Brandon reported errors when deploying:
- "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" - fixed type mismatch (templateId vs template object)
- Favicon 404 - added /public/favicon.svg

**Created unified /create page:**
- Single flow: Mode → Template → Service Details → API Keys → Deploy
- Registers agent + service on-chain AND starts hosted runtime in one go
- Much cleaner than the old separate flows
- Hero CTA now points to /create

- **Pushed to GitHub**: commit 75aec48

### Notes
- Brandon's info still in MEMORY.md from Feb 2025 (AI Product Engineer, Chicago, OnionXBT, LinkedIn agent work)
- Year gap in memory logs (2025-02-06 to 2026-02-08)
