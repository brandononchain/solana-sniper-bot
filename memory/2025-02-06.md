## LinkedIn Revenue Machine - Complete Build

Built comprehensive LinkedIn AI agent system at `/root/clawd/linkedin-agent/`

### What Was Created
- **Core system:** Agent brain, context schemas, operational playbook
- **14 modules:** voice-clone, hook-builder, lead-magnet, outbound, dm-sequences, intent-monitor, trend-analyzer, profile-optimizer, content-repurposing, competitor-intel, social-proof, browser-safe, cron-monitoring, newsletter-integration, sales-navigator
- **Templates:** 8 post templates, onboarding flow, command reference
- **Scripts:** Safe LinkedIn scraper (JS), quick-start setup (bash)
- **Interface:** Conversational (no separate UI - users just talk)

### Skill Registration
- Added YAML frontmatter to SKILL.md for Clawdbot skill detection
- Symlinked to `/root/clawd/skills/linkedin-agent`
- Auto-activates on LinkedIn-related queries

### Brandon Onboarded as First User

Created full profile at `linkedin-agent/data/brandon/`:

**Profile highlights:**
- AI Product Engineer, Chicago
- Background: 100-year family business, decade car sales, self-taught tech
- Projects: GoldX Quant (AI trading agent), Aoris AI, Alta Lab
- Trading: Gold futures, Asian session, supply & demand

**Voice DNA extracted:**
- Technical-builder tone
- Shows real depth (quant, order flow, AI architecture)
- Has unique story (unconventional path)
- Weakness: Too much "please engage" language (fixing)

**Files created:**
- profile.yaml - LinkedIn data
- voice.yaml - Writing voice DNA  
- icp.yaml - 5 target audiences defined
- goals.yaml - Content & outreach targets
- patterns.yaml - What should work for him
- performance.yaml - Tracking template
- vault/hooks.yaml - 75+ hooks
- vault/lead-magnets.yaml - 8 lead magnet ideas
- vault/outreach-templates.yaml - Connection notes & DM sequences

**Deliverables provided:**
- 3 headline options (recommended: service-focused)
- Complete About section rewrite
- 75+ hooks across categories (contrarian, technical, story, trading, frameworks, etc.)

### Key Technical Decisions
- Browser automation is SAFE MODE only (rate limits, human delays, no auto-engage)
- Cron jobs for automated monitoring (morning scan, engage reminders, weekly review)
- Per-user data isolation in `data/{username}/`
- Conversational interface (no separate app needed)

### Next Steps for Brandon
1. Update LinkedIn headline
2. Update About section
3. Start posting with generated hooks
4. Track performance to refine patterns
