## The Call Structure

Total time: 20-30 minutes

| Phase | Time | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| Rapport | 2-3 min | Build connection |
| Situation | 5 min | Understand their current state |
| Problem | 5 min | Uncover pain points |
| Impact | 3 min | Quantify the cost |
| Solution | 5 min | Present your offer |
| Close | 5 min | Get commitment |

---

## Phase 1: Rapport (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Be human. Break the ice.

**Opener:**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for making time. Before we dive in — how's business been lately? Busy season or slow?"

Let them talk. Listen for clues:
- Busy = they need efficiency
- Slow = they need more leads
- Hiring = growth mode
- Frustrated = pain point incoming

**Transition:**
> "Got it. Well, I don't want to waste your time, so let me ask you a few questions to see if what we do even makes sense for you. Cool?"

---

## Phase 2: Situation (5 min)

**Goal:** Understand their current state. Don't pitch yet.

**Questions:**
1. "How are you guys getting most of your leads right now?"
   - (Listen for: website, third-party, walk-ins, referrals)

2. "What does your follow-up process look like when a lead comes in?"
   - (Listen for: who handles it, how fast, what tools)

3. "What happens to leads that don't respond or go cold?"
   - (Listen for: "they sit in the CRM," "we try to call them back," "nothing")

4. "Are you using any automation or AI tools currently?"
   - (Listen for: GHL, DealerSocket, CRM basics)

**Take notes.** Their words become your ammunition later.

---

## Phase 3: Problem (5 min)

**Goal:** Get them to articulate the pain themselves.

**Digging questions:**
1. "If you had to guess, what percentage of your internet leads actually get a response within 5 minutes?"
   - (Most say <20%. Industry average is 47 hours.)

2. "What do you think happens to the leads your team doesn't get to quickly?"
   - (They know: competitor gets them, they go cold)

3. "How many leads would you say go completely cold each month?"
   - (Get a number. 100? 200? This becomes your ROI math.)

4. "Is lead follow-up something your team enjoys, or is it a grind?"
   - (Always a grind. Salespeople want to close, not chase.)

**Mirror their pain:**
> "So if I'm hearing you right, leads are coming in, but follow-up is slow, a lot go cold, and your team would rather be closing than chasing. That sound about right?"

Wait for them to confirm. This is buy-in.

---

## Phase 4: Impact (3 min)

**Goal:** Put a dollar amount on the problem.

**The math:**
> "Let me ask you this — if you're losing, say, 100 leads a month to slow follow-up, and even 10% of those would've bought... at what, $2,000 average front-end gross?"

Let them do the math:
- 100 lost leads × 10% = 10 deals
- 10 deals × $2,000 = $20,000/month left on table

> "So you're potentially leaving $20K+ on the table every month just from follow-up timing. Does that feel about right?"

(If they push back on numbers, adjust. The point is to make the cost tangible.)

---

## Phase 5: Solution (5 min)

**Goal:** Present your offer as the obvious fix.

**Bridge:**
> "So here's what we do, and I'll show you exactly how it works..."

**Demo / Explain:**
> "We set up an AI system that responds to every lead instantly — texts, emails, even after hours. It has real conversations, asks the right questions, and books appointments directly on your team's calendar."

**Show, don't tell:**
- Share screen
- Show sample conversation (AI handling objections)
- Show appointment booking flow
- Show reporting dashboard

**Key points to hit:**
1. **Speed:** Responds in under 60 seconds, 24/7
2. **Conversations:** Not robotic templates — actual back-and-forth
3. **Qualification:** Asks about budget, timeline, vehicle interest
4. **Booking:** Gets them on your calendar automatically
5. **Reactivation:** Works your dead leads, not just new ones

**Social proof:**
> "We did this for [similar dealer], and in the first month they pulled 27 extra appointments from leads they thought were dead."

---

## Phase 6: Close (5 min)

**Goal:** Get a yes, or a clear next step.

**Trial close:**
> "Based on what we talked about, do you see how this could work for you guys?"

(Wait for response. If yes, continue. If concerns, address them.)

**The offer:**
> "Here's what I'd suggest: Let's run a pilot. You give me a few hundred of your oldest, coldest leads — the ones your team has given up on. We'll run our AI on them for 30 days."

> "If we book appointments, you pay us. If we don't, you've lost nothing but leads that were dead anyway."

**Pricing:**
> "For the full system, most dealers are at $3-5K/month depending on volume. For the pilot, I'll do it at half that — $1,500 for the first month. If you're not seeing results, cancel anytime."

**Ask for the close:**
> "Does that feel like a fair way to test this out?"

## Handling Objections

### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally get it. What specifically do you want to think through? Maybe I can help clarify."

(Usually it's price, timing, or buy-in from someone else. Dig to find the real objection.)

### "We already have something"
> "Nice — what are you using?"

(Then:)
> "How's that working for you? Are you hitting the response times and appointment rates you want?"

(If not, position as complementary or replacement.)

### "It's too expensive"
> "I hear you. Let me ask — how much is a quality lead worth to you? And how many are you losing to slow follow-up?"

(Re-anchor to the cost of doing nothing.)

> "At $3K/month, if we get you even 5 extra appointments that turn into 1-2 deals, you're looking at $4-6K in gross. It pays for itself and then some."

### "We tried AI before and it didn't work"
> "What happened?"

(Listen. Usually: bad setup, robotic messages, no customization.)

> "Yeah, a lot of those tools are pretty generic. What we do is different — we customize the AI to your dealership, your inventory, your style. It's not one-size-fits-all."

### "I need to talk to my partner/owner"
> "Totally understand. Would it help if I put together a one-pager you can share with them? Or would a quick call with all of us be easier?"

(Get the next step scheduled before you hang up.)

### "Send me more info"
> "Happy to. I'll send over a summary of what we discussed plus a quick video showing exactly how it works. What's the best email?"

> "And just so I'm not following up forever — when should I check back in if I don't hear from you?"

(Lock in a follow-up date.)
