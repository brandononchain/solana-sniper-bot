## AI-Powered Lead Generation & Appointment Setting for Car Dealerships

## Executive Summary

DealerFlow AI provides done-for-you AI lead generation and appointment setting for independent and mid-size car dealerships. We use AI-powered scraping, enrichment, personalized outreach, and automated follow-up to deliver qualified appointments directly to sales teams.

**Why this works:**
- Dealerships spend $300-500 per third-party lead with 10-15% contact rates
- Their internal follow-up is slow, inconsistent, and loses 60%+ of leads
- AI can respond in seconds, follow up persistently, and book appointments 24/7
- You understand their world — speak their language, know their pain

## Client Acquisition Strategy

### Phase 1: Warm Outreach (Week 1-4) — $0 cost
Your 4,000+ LinkedIn connections are gold. Here's the play:

**Step 1: Profile Optimization**
- Headline: "Helping Dealerships Get 30+ Extra Appointments/Month with AI"
- Banner: Simple visual showing the transformation
- About: Case study format (even if it's a mock pilot initially)

**Step 2: Connection Audit**
- Export connections (LinkedIn allows this)
- Filter for: dealership owners, GMs, sales managers, automotive industry
- Build a list of 200-500 targets

**Step 3: Warm DM Sequence**
Message 1 (Day 1):
> "Hey [Name], been a while! Saw you're still at [Dealership] — hope business is strong. Quick question: are you guys still struggling with lead follow-up, or have you figured that out?"

Message 2 (Day 3, if no reply):
> "No worries if you're slammed. Just asking because I've been helping dealerships use AI to reactivate their dead leads — one client pulled 23 extra appointments last month from leads they thought were worthless. Thought of you."

Message 3 (Day 7):
> "Last ping — if lead follow-up isn't a pain point right now, totally get it. But if you're curious how AI appointment setters work, happy to show you a quick demo. No pitch, just cool tech."

**Conversion target:** 5% of warm outreach → discovery calls → close 30% = first 2-3 clients

### Phase 2: Cold Outreach (Week 3+) — ~$200/month
Once the system is built, scale with cold outreach:

**Targeting:**
- Independent dealerships (5-50 employees)
- Used car dealers (higher margins, more pain)
- Geographic focus: Start with 2-3 states, expand

**Channels:**
1. **Cold Email** (Instantly.ai)
   - 3 domains, warmed for 2 weeks
   - 100-150 emails/day across domains
   - Personalized with Clay enrichment
   
2. **LinkedIn Automation** (Phantom Buster)
   - Connection requests + DM sequences
   - 50-80 requests/day
   
3. **Cold Calling** (Optional, use Bland.ai)
   - AI qualifies, you close
   - Or hire a VA for $500/mo to set calls

**Email Template Example:**
Subject: "quick question about [Dealership Name]"

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Saw [Dealership] has solid reviews but noticed your response time on leads might be costing you.
>
> We help dealerships like yours use AI to:
> → Respond to every lead in <60 seconds (even at 2am)
> → Reactivate dead leads (avg. 20-30 extra appointments/month)
> → Book directly to your sales team's calendar
>
> Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits?
>
> — [Your Name]

### Phase 3: Referrals & Case Studies (Month 2+)
- Offer clients $500 for every referral that closes
- Build video case studies (even 2-minute Looms)
- Post results on LinkedIn weekly (builds authority)
