## WEEK 2: Build Automation Systems

This is what you sell first — low risk for client, fast results.

  - Stages: New Lead → Contacted → Engaged → Appointment Set → Showed → Sold
- [ ] Build SMS sequence in GHL (AI-powered):
  ```
  Message 1 (Day 0): 
  "Hey {first_name}, this is [Bot Name] from [Dealership]. 
  I saw you were looking at vehicles a while back — are you still in the market, 
  or did you find something?"
  
  Message 2 (Day 1, if no reply):
  "No pressure at all! Just wanted to check in. 
  If you're still looking, we have some great options right now. 
  Want me to check what's available in your price range?"
  
  Message 3 (Day 3):
  "Last check-in from me! If you're set, no worries. 
  But if timing just wasn't right before, let me know — 
  I can get you in with one of our guys whenever works."
  ```
- [ ] Build appointment booking flow:
  - If lead shows interest → AI asks qualifying questions
  - Collects: timeline, budget range, vehicle type
  - Offers available slots

## WEEK 4: Close First Clients

### Discovery Call Framework

  1. **Rapport** (2 min): How's business? What's the vibe?

  3. **Problem** (5 min): What's falling through the cracks? How many leads go cold?
  4. **Impact** (3 min): What does that cost you monthly?
  5. **Solution** (5 min): Walk through how your system works
  6. **Close** (5 min): "Want to run a pilot? First month half-off, cancel anytime."
