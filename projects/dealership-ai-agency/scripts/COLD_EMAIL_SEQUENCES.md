## Sequence 1: Problem-Aware (Primary)

### Email 1: The Problem Poke
**Subject:** quick question about [Company Name]

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Noticed [Dealership Name] has solid reviews — clearly doing something right.
>
> Quick question though: how fast does your team typically respond to internet leads?
>
> I ask because most dealerships I talk to say they lose 50%+ of leads just because follow-up takes too long. The good leads go cold, or worse — buy from the dealer who texted back first.
>
> Is that something you're dealing with, or have you figured it out?
>
> — [Your Name]

**Why it works:** Opens with compliment, asks a question (invites reply), plants the problem without pitching.

---

### Email 2: The Proof Drop (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: quick question about [Company Name]

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Wanted to follow up with something you might find useful.
>
> Just helped a dealership in [State/City] reactivate 400 "dead" leads using AI — the ones their team had given up on.
>
> Result: 27 appointments booked in 3 weeks. All automated — no extra work for their sales team.
>
> If that sounds interesting, I can show you exactly how it works in 15 minutes.
>
> Here's my calendar: [Cal.com link]
>
> Either way, hope business is strong.
>
> — [Your Name]

**Why it works:** Specific result, low-commitment ask, shows confidence.

---

### Email 3: The Breakup (Day 7)
**Subject:** closing the loop

> Hey [First Name],
>
> I've reached out a couple times — totally understand if this isn't a priority right now.
>
> If lead follow-up isn't a pain point, I'll drop it.
>
> But if it is, and you just haven't had time — here's a quick 3-minute video showing what we do: [Loom link]
>
> Either way, no hard feelings. Best of luck with everything.
>
> — [Your Name]

**Why it works:** Gives them an out, provides passive content, feels human.

## Sequence 2: Results-Led

### Email 1: The Case Study Hook
**Subject:** how [Similar Dealership] got 30 extra appointments/month

> Hey [First Name],
>
> [Similar Dealership Name] was losing leads because their follow-up took 4+ hours.
>
> We set up an AI system that:
> → Responds to every lead in under 60 seconds
> → Has real conversations (not robotic templates)
> → Books appointments directly to their calendar
>
> First month: 30 extra appointments from leads they would've lost.
>
> Would something like this be useful at [Dealership Name]?
>
> — [Your Name]

---

### Email 2: The Specifics (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: how [Similar Dealership] got 30 extra appointments/month

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Quick follow-up with more details:
>
> Here's what the AI actually does:
> 1. Responds instantly via text/email (24/7)
> 2. Asks qualifying questions (budget, timeline, vehicle type)
> 3. Overcomes objections ("just looking" → "want to see what's available?")
> 4. Books appointments on your team's calendar
>
> Your sales team just shows up to appointments. Everything else is handled.
>
> Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits? [Cal.com link]
>
> — [Your Name]

---

### Email 3: Video Follow-Up (Day 6)
**Subject:** made you a quick video

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Rather than keep typing — I made a 2-minute video showing exactly what this looks like:
>
> [Loom link]
>
> If it's not for you, no worries at all. But if it sparks any questions, I'm around.
>
> — [Your Name]

---

## Sequence 3: Dead Lead Reactivation Angle

### Email 1: The "Hidden Gold" Hook
**Subject:** the leads you're sitting on

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Quick question: what happens to leads that don't buy in the first 30 days?
>
> Most dealerships let them sit in the CRM and die. But here's the thing — 35-50% of those "dead" leads eventually buy a car. Just not from you.
>
> We've built an AI system that reactivates those old leads automatically. It texts them, has conversations, and books appointments — without your team lifting a finger.
>
> Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how it works?
>
> — [Your Name]

---

### Email 2: The Math (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: the leads you're sitting on

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Let me make this concrete:
>
> Say you have 500 dead leads in your CRM. Industry average says 10-15% will still buy a car within 6 months.
>
> That's 50-75 potential deals sitting there.
>
> At $2,000 avg front-end profit, that's $100-150K in revenue you're leaving on the table.
>
> Our AI system typically reactivates 5-8% of dead leads into appointments.
>
> Worth a call? [Cal.com link]
>
> — [Your Name]

---

### Email 3: Low-Risk Offer (Day 8)
**Subject:** no-risk pilot?

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Last email — promise.
>
> If you're skeptical (fair), here's an idea:
>
> Give us 200-300 of your oldest, most dead leads. We'll run our AI on them for 2 weeks.
>
> If we book appointments, great — you pay us.
> If we don't, you've lost nothing.
>
> Interested? [Cal.com link]
>
> — [Your Name]

## Subject Line Swipes

**Curiosity:**
- quick question about [Company]
- re: [Company] leads
- idea for [Company]
- saw this and thought of you

**Results:**
- how [X dealership] added 30 appointments/month
- [Number] appointments from dead leads
- what [X dealership] did differently

**Pattern interrupts:**

- are you the right person?
- should I stop emailing?

**Personalized:**
- [First Name] — quick thought
- for [First Name] at [Company]

## Personalization Variables (Pull from Clay)

- {first_name}
- {company_name}
- {city}
- {state}
- {company_size}
- {recent_news} (if available)
- {linkedin_headline}
- {tech_stack} (if they use specific CRM)

**Example with personalization:**
> Hey {first_name}, saw {company_name} is hiring sales staff — sounds like business is good. With growth comes more leads to manage. How's your follow-up process holding up?
