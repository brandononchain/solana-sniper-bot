# LinkedIn DM Templates — Warm Outreach

## For People You Actually Know

### Sequence A: The Casual Reconnect

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
> Hey [Name]! Been a while — hope things at [Dealership] are going well.
>
> Quick question: are you guys still dealing with the whole lead follow-up headache, or have you figured that out?

**Message 2 (Day 3, no reply):**
> No worries if you're slammed! Just asking because I've been helping dealerships use AI to work their dead leads — one client pulled 23 extra appointments last month from leads they thought were toast.
>
> Thought of you.

**Message 3 (Day 7, no reply):**
> Last ping from me! If lead follow-up isn't a pain point right now, totally get it.
>
> But if you're curious how AI appointment setters actually work, I'd be happy to show you a quick demo — no pitch, just cool tech. Let me know.

### Sequence B: The Direct Value Offer

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
> Hey [Name] — saw you're killing it at [Dealership]. Quick thought for you:
>
> I've been building AI systems that reactivate old leads for dealerships. Basically, it texts/emails your dead leads, has real conversations, and books appointments while your team sleeps.
>
> Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time, or is that not a priority right now?

**Message 2 (Day 4, no reply):**
> Figured you might be busy — no stress.
>
> Just so you know what I mean: one dealer gave me 400 "dead" leads, and we pulled 27 appointments in the first 3 weeks. All automated.
>
> Let me know if you want to see how.

**Message 3 (Day 8, no reply):**
> Alright, I'll take the hint 😄 If this ever becomes a priority, just ping me. Happy to help whenever.

## For Loose Connections / 2nd Degree

### Sequence C: The Mutual Connection Play

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
> Hey [Name] — we're connected through [mutual connection / group / industry]. Noticed you're in the automotive space.
>
> Random question: do you ever feel like your team's follow-up on leads could be faster/better, or is that pretty dialed in?

**Message 2 (Day 3):**
> Not trying to sell you anything — genuinely curious. I've been obsessing over how AI can fix the lead follow-up problem for dealerships. Most I talk to say they lose 50%+ of leads just because response time is too slow.
>
> Is that real, or am I off base?

**Message 3 (Day 7):**
> Last message from me! If you're ever curious what AI appointment setting actually looks like, happy to show you. Either way, keep crushing it. 🤙

### Sequence D: The Insight/Value First

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
> Hey [Name] — quick insight I thought you'd find interesting:
>
> Harvard study found that responding to a lead in 5 minutes vs. 30 minutes = 100x more likely to connect. Most dealerships average 47 hours.
>
> I've been building AI that responds in 60 seconds. Thought you might find it relevant given what you do at [Dealership].

**Message 2 (Day 4):**
> Not sure if that landed — but I've got a quick video showing exactly how it works if you're curious. Takes 3 minutes to watch.
>
> Want me to send it over?

**Message 3 (Day 8):**
> I'll drop it here anyway in case it's useful: [link to Loom video or landing page]
>
> No pressure — just thought it might spark some ideas. Happy to chat if it does.

## Messages That Tank (Avoid These)

❌ "Hi [Name], hope you're well! I'm reaching out because..."
(Sounds like every bad pitch ever)

❌ "I'd love to set up a call to discuss how we can help..."
(Too fast, no value)

❌ "Are you the right person to speak to about..."
(Feels like cold outreach even if they know you)

❌ "I noticed you work in automotive, and we specialize in..."
(All about you, not them)

❌ Walls of text with features and benefits
(Nobody reads those)

## Response Handlers

**"Not interested"**
> Totally fair — appreciate you letting me know. If anything changes, I'm here. Best of luck! 🤙

**"Maybe later"**
> No problem at all. Mind if I check back in a month or two? No pressure either way.

**"Tell me more"**
> Awesome — easiest way is a quick call. Here's my calendar: [link]
> If you prefer, I can send a 3-minute video walkthrough instead. What works?

**"How much does it cost?"**
> Depends on what you need. Most clients are in the $3-7K/month range, but happy to customize.
> Worth a quick call to see if it even makes sense for you? [link]

**"We already have something"**
