## Your Week 1 Priorities

### Day 1-2: Business Foundation
1. **Choose your business name** (suggestions below)

3. **Register LLC** (ZenBusiness: ~$150)

**Name ideas:**
- DealerFlow AI
- AutoPilot Leads
- LeadShift AI
- PitStop AI
- DealerPulse
- LotLeads AI

### Day 3-4: Tech Stack Setup
1. **GoHighLevel** — Sign up for Agency Unlimited ($97/mo)
2. **Apollo.io** — Starter plan ($49/mo)
3. **Instantly.ai** — Growth plan ($37/mo)
4. **Make.com** — Core plan ($9/mo)

**Also set up:**
- 3 domains for cold email (~$30)
- Google Workspace for each domain ($18/mo)
- OpenAI API account ($20 credit)

## Your Week 2-3 Priorities

### Build the Automation Stack

3. Set up AI responses
4. Configure appointment booking

### Start Outreach
1. **Export LinkedIn connections** (LinkedIn Settings → Get a copy of your data)
2. **Filter for automotive contacts** (aim for 100-200)
3. **Start DM sequence** using [LINKEDIN_DM_TEMPLATES.md](./scripts/LINKEDIN_DM_TEMPLATES.md)
4. **Daily rhythm:** 20-30 new conversations started per day

## The Math That Makes This Work

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Outreach/week | 100 | 200 | 300 |
| Reply rate | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| Calls booked | 5 | 20 | 45 |
| Close rate | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| New clients/month | 1 | 6 | 18 |
| Revenue at $5K avg | $5K | $30K | $90K |

**Even conservative gets you to $60K/year from your LinkedIn alone.**

## Month-by-Month Revenue Trajectory

| Month | Clients | MRR | Cumulative Effort |
|-------|---------|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | 2 | $10K | Setup + first sales |
| 2 | 5 | $25K | Systems running |
| 3 | 8 | $40K | Hire VA |
| 4 | 11 | $55K | Case studies live |
| 5 | 14 | $70K | Referrals starting |
| 6 | 17 | $85K | Scale outreach |
| 7 | 20+ | $100K+ | Target achieved |

## Budget Breakdown

### Initial ($1,000)
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| LLC registration | $150 |
| Domains (4 total) | $50 |
| First month tech stack | $400 |
| Reserve buffer | $400 |

### Monthly Operating (Once Running)
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| GoHighLevel | $97 |
| Apollo.io | $49 |
| Instantly.ai | $37 |
| Make.com | $9-16 |
| Google Workspace | $18 |
| OpenAI API | $20-50 |
| **Total** | ~$250-300/mo |

**Breakeven:** 1 client at $3K covers your costs + profit.

## What You're Selling (Simple Version)

**Problem:** Dealerships pay $300-500 per lead but lose 60%+ because follow-up is slow and inconsistent.

**Solution:** AI that responds in 60 seconds, works 24/7, has real conversations, and books appointments automatically.

**Offer:** 
- Tier 1 ($3K/mo): Lead reactivation — work their dead leads
- Tier 2 ($7.5K/mo): Full pipeline — new leads + reactivation + chat
- Pilot ($1.5K): 30-day trial on their cold leads

---

## Your Unfair Advantages

1. **Industry knowledge** — You speak their language (automotive sales)
2. **Existing network** — 4,000+ LinkedIn connections
3. **Timing** — AI tools just became accessible enough
4. **Low overhead** — No-code stack keeps costs minimal
5. **High-ticket recurring** — One good client = $3K+/month forever

---

## Red Flags to Watch

⚠️ **No replies after 200+ messages** — Rework your messaging/offer
⚠️ **Calls but no closes** — Review sales script, maybe pricing issue
⚠️ **Client churn after month 1** — Results delivery problem
⚠️ **Overwhelmed at 5+ clients** — Hire VA immediately
